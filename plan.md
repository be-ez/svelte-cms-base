# Project Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Using SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5, TailwindCSS 4, and TypeScript
- **Content Management**: Directus CMS integration for dynamic content
- **Image Optimization**: Sophisticated image pipeline with Sharp for multiple formats and sizes
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode toggle with CSS variables
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code standards
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with separate mobile/desktop navigation
- **Build System**: Well-configured Vite with image optimization plugins

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Performance Optimizations

#### Missing Web Performance Features

- [ ] Add resource hints (`<link rel="preconnect">`, `<link rel="dns-prefetch">`)
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline support and caching
- [ ] Add `loading="eager"` for above-the-fold images
- [ ] Consider implementing Intersection Observer for lazy loading components

#### Bundle Size Optimization

- [ ] Analyze and potentially code-split large dependencies
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for route-specific components
- [ ] Add bundle size visualization to build process

#### Build Optimizations

- [ ] Enable precompression in the static adapter config
- [ ] Add critical CSS inlining
- [ ] Implement resource hashing for better caching

### 2. SEO Improvements

#### Missing SEO Essentials

- [ ] No sitemap.xml generation
- [ ] No robots.txt file
- [ ] Missing meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- [ ] No structured data (JSON-LD)
- [ ] Missing canonical URLs

#### Recommended Implementation

- [ ] Create dynamic sitemap generation
- [ ] Add comprehensive meta tag management
- [ ] Implement breadcrumb navigation with schema markup
- [ ] Add RSS feed generation for blog posts

### 3. Security Enhancements

#### Missing Security Headers

- [ ] No Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- [ ] No HTTPS enforcement in configuration

#### Environment Variables

- [ ] Consider using runtime environment variables for Docker deployments
- [ ] Add validation for required environment variables
- [ ] Implement secret rotation strategy

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

#### Current Gaps

- [ ] Limited aria-labels found (only on theme toggle)
- [ ] Missing skip-to-content link
- [ ] No focus trap for mobile navigation
- [ ] Need keyboard navigation testing

#### Recommendations

- [ ] Add comprehensive ARIA labels and roles
- [ ] Implement focus management for route changes
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Include accessibility testing in CI/CD

### 5. Developer Experience

#### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] No test files found - add unit tests with Vitest
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing

#### Development Tools

- [ ] Add development-specific error boundaries
- [ ] Implement better error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add performance profiling tools
- [ ] Create component documentation with Storybook

### 6. Code Quality & Architecture

#### Type Safety

- [ ] Some TypeScript errors suppressed with `@ts-expect-error`
- [ ] Add proper typing for Directus SDK responses
- [ ] Implement stricter TypeScript configuration

#### Component Architecture

- [ ] Consider implementing a design system
- [ ] Add more reusable utility components
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add loading states and skeletons

### 7. Feature Enhancements

#### Content Features

- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Implement content pagination
- [ ] Add related posts/content suggestions
- [ ] Include comment system or reactions

#### User Experience

- [ ] Add page transition animations
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll for photo galleries
- [ ] Add image lightbox/modal viewer
- [ ] Include share functionality for posts

### 8. Infrastructure & Deployment

#### Docker Optimization

- [ ] Multi-stage build is good, but consider Alpine-specific optimizations
- [ ] Add health checks to Dockerfile
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handling

#### Monitoring

- [ ] Add application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Implement error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Add analytics (privacy-focused options like Plausible)

### 9. Content Management

#### Directus Integration

- [ ] Add webhook support for content updates
- [ ] Implement content preview functionality
- [ ] Add draft/published state handling
- [ ] Include content versioning support

### 10. Mobile Experience

#### Progressive Web App

- [ ] Add web app manifest
- [ ] Implement install prompts
- [ ] Add offline page
- [ ] Include push notification support

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Add SEO meta tags and sitemap generation** - Critical for search visibility
2. **Implement security headers** - Essential for production deployment
3. **Add basic test coverage** - Prevents regression bugs
4. **Fix accessibility gaps** - Ensures inclusive user experience

### Medium Priority

1. **Implement service worker for offline support** - Enhances user experience
2. **Add error tracking and monitoring** - Essential for production maintenance
3. **Optimize bundle size** - Improves performance
4. **Add search functionality** - Enhances content discoverability

### Low Priority

1. **Implement advanced features** (comments, reactions) - Nice-to-have features
2. **Add visual regression testing** - Prevents UI regressions
3. **Create component documentation** - Improves developer experience
4. **Implement PWA features** - Modern web app capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Start with high-priority items that have immediate impact
2. Focus on one area at a time to maintain quality
3. Implement proper testing for each new feature
4. Document decisions and maintain this plan as a living document

This project has a solid foundation with good architectural decisions. The main areas for improvement are around SEO, security, testing, and progressive enhancement features that would make it production-ready for a high-traffic website.
